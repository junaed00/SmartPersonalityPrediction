#### Five Personality Traits (OCEAN)
Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is for grouping different personality traits.

This theory uses descriptors of common language and suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche. The theory identifies five factors:

* Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
* Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)
* Extroversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
* Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)
* Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)

This data set was collected (2016-2018) through an interactive on-line personality test. The personality test was constructed from the IPIP. 

The scale was labeled between 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree.

You can find more info about each question in the data set link.

In this study I will analyse the data set and use unsupervised learning algorithm K-Means Clustering for clustering the participants.
